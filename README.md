●	Difficulty Level: beginner
●	Target Audience: students with little to no programming knowledge
●	Duration of workshop: 45-60 minutes
●	Needed materials: a computer, internet acess, the starter files
●	learning outcomes: students will learn basic programming topics including, loops, if statements, sprites, and moving objects using cordinates.
●	This project was created to show students of all ages that programming is not a scary concept and that anyone can learn it.  The game was created by using scratch, scratch is a free block based coding tool created by MIT to generate intrest in programming around the world.  during a comparasion of before and after surveys, there was a clear improvement in the number of students that correctly answered the questions.
