# LightUp: Teaching Programming Basics with Scratch
## Description
-	Difficulty Level: Beginner
-	Target Audience: High School - College
-	Duration of workshop: 75-120 minutes
-	Needed materials: Computer, Internet Access, Starter Files
-	The goal of this project is to introduce students to basic programming topics such as if statements and loops by using Scratch sprites and coordinates.
-	By participating in this workshop students will get to experiment with Scratch a free block based coding tool created by MIT to generate their own mini programming project.
-	The Technology Ambassador Program ([TAP](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.
