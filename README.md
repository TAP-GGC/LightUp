# LightUp: Teaching Programming Basics with Scratch
## Description:
-	Difficulty Level: Beginner
-	Target Audience: High School - College
-	Duration of workshop: 45-60 minutes
-	Needed materials: Computer, Internet Access, Starter Files
-	The goal of this project is to introduce students to basic programming topics such as if statements and loops by using Scratch sprites and coordinates.
-	By participating in this workshop students will get to experiment with Scratch a free block based coding tool created by MIT to generate their own mini programming project.
-	The Technology Ambassador Program ([TAP](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

## Project Setup/Installation
- download the "TAPS Light-up Start v4.sb3" file, it is a blank file that has all the nessasary assets for the project  
-	download the powerpoint, it has step by step instrucions, common problems, and how to fix them.
### note: scratch does not need to be downloaded for the project to work, the browser version works too
### note 2: if distrabution of the starter file proves dificult, a web version of the starter file can be found here https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/971345619/ 


## Short demo instructions
-	full detaills can be found in the powerpoint file
-	drag and drop blocks to build the yellow light and yellow arrow code, repeat the steps for the other colors, changing coordinates and input as needed

10.	Workshop Instructions
-	Instructions are avalible in the powerpoint
-	google drive for videos: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Pm2NiikX8k9fnfElErNB25cGI0kZvDr/view?usp=drive_link
